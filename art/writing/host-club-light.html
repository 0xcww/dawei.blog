                <h3>THE FIRST AMERICAN TO WORK IN A TAIWANESE HOST CLUB AND TAIWAN 8+9</h3>
            </center>
            <br>

            <p>As far as I know, I was the first (non-mixed) "white guy" to work in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_and_hostess_clubs" target="_blank">host club</a> in Taiwan. My <strong>幹部 (gànbù)</strong>—or manager—always stated this with extreme conviction, but if you have the receipts to prove otherwise, feel free to steal my thunder. Just please don't put this on my headstone.</p>

            <p>The opportunity arose when a friend mentioned a contact in the industry, and my Chinese ability provided the introduction. I had a previous interest in Taiwanese karaoke as a sort of "hyperobject," and at the time, I was in a unique position. Most other foreigners in Taiwan were not equipped linguistically, nor did they possess the slightly delusional and obstinate desire to push inculturation to its absolute limit—beyond just learning a few swear words in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien" target="_blank"><strong>台語 (táiyǔ)</strong></a>.</p>

            <p>I hesitated at first. My brief stint on the Taiwanese variety show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyi-Ztspx3ak8Y5MFFSlMiUi4hSAUjVCl" target="_blank"><strong>二分之一強 (èr fēn zhī yī qiáng)</strong></a> had felt like vapid drivel, largely souring me on chasing local stardom for the time being. But curiosity won out. I decided that, for a short time on a path less traveled, I might as well get paid for the experience.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Entering the Sea: <strong>下海 (xiàhǎi)</strong></h3>

            <p>In the industry, they call the act of joining the nightlife <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8B%E6%B5%B7" target="_blank"><strong>下海 (xiàhǎi)</strong></a>—literally "entering the sea." It's an apt metaphor for the <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AB%E5%A4%A7%E8%A1%8C%E6%A5%AD" target="_blank"><strong>八大行業 (bādà hángyè)</strong></a>, or the "Eight Great Industries." This term covers a wide swath of service, nightlife, and sex-work-adjacent jobs, existing as a frothy mixture of money, desire, and partying until noon.</p>

            <p>The job is brutal. To find success as a <strong>男模 (nánmó)</strong>, you are pushed to drink—heavily. You must be a sparkling conversationalist, a stylish dresser, and capable of drinking a fifth of whiskey in one sitting while performing trending DouYin dances. There are endless cultural nuances to heed. The concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(sociological_concept)" target="_blank"><strong>面子 (miànzi)</strong></a> is paramount, albeit fairly intuitive. Likewise, the unspoken rules of the host karaoke system come with their own lexicon. Failing to grasp them quickly can spell trouble for both you and your employer—though as the token American, I was afforded significant leeway.</p>

            <h3>The Unpredictable Tides of <strong>林森北路 (línsēn běilù)</strong></h3>

            <p>Living life as a regular on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linsen_North_Road" target="_blank"><strong>林森北路 (línsēn běilù)</strong></a> taught me that boozed-up temperaments are like waves: they have a rhythm, but they are wholly unpredictable. I was once almost beaten because someone mistook my white hat for that of a rival. On another occasion, someone drank themselves to death at my regular hangout; the next day, you couldn't get a reservation because so many customers wanted to "check out" the spot where it happened.</p>

            <p>It grew tiresome walking on eggshells, listening to the same cycles of worry about money and intoxication. Some nights felt like clocking into a corporate team-building event, just with the veneer of singing and booze. But like any vice, the hits of dopamine and lust provide a strange evidence that you were "there."</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Going Ashore: <strong>上岸 (shàngàn)</strong></h3>

            <p>This brings us to the industry's counterpart: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8A%E5%B2%B8" target="_blank"><strong>上岸 (shàngàn)</strong></a>, or "going ashore." Typically, this refers to a host or hostess finding a "sugar mama" or a "kept man" situation—a way to leave the labor of the clubs for a stable, material life. While that sounds convenient to some, I realized my goals were different. I wasn't looking for a benefactor; I was looking for an exit from the script.</p>

            <p>Most foreigners in Taiwan experience a "scripted" existence where every conversation follows the same pattern for the first few minutes. I thought that by diving into the deepest parts of the "sea," I would find something more authentic. Instead, I found that the nightlife has its own script, written in whiskey and exhaustion.</p>

            <p>I am putting this on the internet to freeze these experiences in amber. It is cathartic to document these nights so I do not fall back into unhealthy habits. I remember plenty of nights where I had no answer to the question: <em>"What the hell am I doing here, at this time, with these people?"</em></p>

            <p>I may have been the first American to <strong>下海 (xiàhǎi)</strong> in this specific corner of Taiwan, but the most satisfying part of the journey was finally deciding to <strong>上岸 (shàngàn)</strong>. I stepped off the path less traveled and realized that while the view from the bottom was unique, the air back on the shore is much easier to breathe.</p>
