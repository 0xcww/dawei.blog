                <p>The Ice Cold ROG campaign was one of my favorites at this gig. It was a holiday giveaway + UGC push for one of the most beloved PC gaming brands.</p>
                <p>I created branded paper ornaments for fans to cut out and decorate. People from all over the world sent in photos of their trees. We used Gleam to drive a ton of impressions and engagement, and I looped in laptop + phone teams to broaden the reach and build goodwill. (Plus lots of happy winners worldwide.)</p>

                <p>ROG was the first gaming brand to successfully leverage a K-pop fandom. By engaging authentically with the IZ*ONE community and coordinating with the ASUS Korea office, I helped land a sponsored tweet that became a fan inside joke and generated huge goodwill with new audiences.</p>

                <h4>Even more ROG</h4>
                <p>I also ran motherboard, GPU, and gaming monitor chipset launches that required tight cross-company marketing with NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, game publishers, and even IKEA. Favorites include the B550 motherboard launches, the NVIDIA #ultimatecountdown campaign, and Intel X470 chipset launches.</p>
                <p>I handled creative photography, product videos, branding, and social-first content. I even built an Instagram filter with SparkAR before Meta shut down community-made filters.</p>

                <p>In this role, I grew and engaged the developer and builder community through strategic content creation and coordination of high-impact marketing initiatives, including live demos, milestone announcements, and ecosystem storytelling around verifiable compute, deterministic AI inference, and agentic use cases like verifiable aggregation, random jury selection, policy-gated wallets, and single-click bot deployments. These efforts boosted visibility, fostered builder participation, and highlighted real-world applications of trustless AI and off-chain verification to accelerate adoption in the decentralized AI and crypto space.</p>
                <p>One of the coolest things I did was partner with my support engineer to connect four differently branded Discord bots—trained on internal content, each with its own personality—then pipe them into our server via Python. Users could chat with them to learn about EigenLayer, restaking, and crypto + AI.</p>
                <p>Other community engagement tasks included POAP collection campaigns, UGC and ideathons, social media campaigns, questing, rebranding, UI/UX feedback, customer support and product feedback from both stakers as well as node operators.</p>

                <p>Working for an event is a bit different from a start up. There is a huge crunch to cover all the sponsors and speakers who make the event possible, without the posts devolving into just ads or slop that noone is interested in.</p>

                <h4>BLK SODA</h4>
                <p>I still like working with PC hardware, so I did some contract work for a local Taipei agency called BLK SODA. They were promoting a 3 sided tempered glass case that was making waves in the PC DIY market (the <a href="https://lian-li.com/product/o11-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O11 Vision</a>) as well as some cool modular chassis fans that come with an LCD screen directly in the fan (<a href="https://lian-li.com/product-category/cooling/fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lian Li fans</a>).</p>
                <p>I did some studio photography as well as fast edited vertical videos with CapCut + Premiere. In addition to green screening memes onto visually pleasing visuals, the enthusiast car edits here are great reference.
