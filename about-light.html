                <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            </center>
<br> 

            Hi, my name is Curtis. I’m currently at a crossroads in my life laying low (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_ping">躺平</a>).<br><br>
            One of my major goals in 2026 is to find an altruistic project that can survive on its own.<br><br>

I like having a broad range of work experience. I've done all kinds of labor and service, I’ve worked in the Taiwanese tech industry, and most recently some web3 and AI start ups. <br><br>
 
I’m from Oregon, but have lived in Taiwan for a long time. <br>
I have a big fluffy white cat. <br>
I am pretty good at Mandarin.<br>
I enjoy cooking and singing karaoke.  

            <br><br>
